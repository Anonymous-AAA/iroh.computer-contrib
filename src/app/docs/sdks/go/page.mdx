# Iroh Go SDK

Use iroh directly from go. {{ className: 'lead' }}

We went to [great lengths](https://github.com/NordSecurity/uniffi-bindgen-go/pull/13) to land support for iroh in Go. It's written as a go package that calls out to the iroh rust implementation via a set of c-bindings, giving the same performance characteristics as the rust implementation with the ease of go.

## Getting Started

Install the [iroh go module](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/iroh.go) with [`go get`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Add_dependencies_to_current_module_and_install_them). 
You then need to run an install script that downloads and saves the correct c-bindings for your platform.
We currently only have an `InstallGo` script for Linux and MacOs.

```bash
$ go get github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/iroh-go/iroh
$ git submodule add https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi.git extern/iroh-ffi
$ make -f extern/iroh-ffi/InstallGo
$ go mod edit -replace=github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/iroh-go=./extern/iroh-ffi/iroh-go
```

## Learning the API

<Note>
  The Go SDK is missing package documentation, the best reference to use for now is the [API documentation](/docs/api)
</Note>

The [API documentation](/docs/api) is the best place to learn about the API. Each command includes a go example to help build your understanding of how iroh works, which you can compose together to meet your needs.
