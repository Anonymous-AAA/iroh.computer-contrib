# Iroh Python SDK

Use iroh directly from python. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Iroh in Python is one of the most expressive combinations of language and framework. It's written as a python package that calls out to the iroh rust implementation via a set of c-bindings, giving the same performance characteristics as the rust implementation with the ease of python. The python package is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/iroh/).

## Getting Started

Install [`the iroh python package`](https://pypi.org/project/iroh) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
$ pip install iroh
```

## Learning the API

<Note>
  The Python SDK is missing package documentation, the best reference to use for now is the [API documentation](/docs/api)
</Note>

The [API documentation](/docs/api) is the best place to learn about the API. Each command includes a python example to help build your understanding of how Iroh works, which you can compose together to meet your needs.
