# Configuration

While iroh is primarily a library it also supplies a CLI which is useful for exploring various parts of iroh.
The iroh CLI uses [persistent node storage] and also supports a configuration file.
Below are the details of where these are located and how they are used. {{className: 'lead'}}

When using iroh as a library, check the documenetation of the library to see what the defaults are.

[persistent node storage]: https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/node/struct.Node.html#method.persistent


## Ports

An iroh node binds to two ports by default:

| Service                | Default Port | Description |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Iroh Listening Address | 11204        | Address iroh listens on for connections from other nodes. If the port is taken iroh will choose a random port to listen on. | 
| RPC                    | 1337         | Localhost-only Remote Procedure Calls, used to control an iroh node from another process. If the port is taken iroh will fail to start. |



## Data Directory

By default the iroh CLI persists to a data directory that keeps any data that should be kept across restarts.
The location of that directory is platform specific:

| Platform | Value                                              | Example                                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_DATA_HOME`/iroh or `$HOME`/.local/share/iroh | /home/alice/.local/share/iroh                 |
| macOS    | `$HOME`/Library/Application Support/iroh           | /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/iroh |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}/iroh`                   | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\iroh           |

If the `IROH_DATA_DIR` environment variable is set,
all other values will be ignored in favour of `IROH_DATA_DIR`.
If the directory path does not exist, 
iroh will attempt to create all directories in the path string (similar to `mkdir -p` on Unix systems),
failing if the final path cannot be written to.

<Note>
A common pattern for creating "one off" iroh nodes is to run `IROH_DATA_DIR=./iroh iroh start`.
</Note>

### Log files

By default `iroh` will create log files in `$IROH_DATA_DIR/logs`, named `iroh.YYYY-MM-DD-HH.log`.

---

## Configuration file

The configuration directory also has a platform-specific default value:

| Platform | Value                                      | Example                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME`/.config/iroh | /home/alice/.config/iroh                      |
| macOS    | `$HOME`/Library/Application Support/iroh   | /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/iroh |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}`/iroh           | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\iroh           |

If the `IROH_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable is set,
all other values will be ignored in favour of `IROH_CONFIG_DIR`.

The iroh CLI loads configuration from the `$IROH_CONFIG_DIR/iroh.config.toml` file.
The file is in [TOML format],
and all values are optional,
including the file itself.

[TOML format]: https://toml.io/en/

Iroh does _not_ create `iroh.config.toml` by default.

### Relay nodes

Relay nodes are used to assist in holepunching and are identified by their url.
They assist in [establishing connections].
Number0 currently runs two relay nodes,
one in North America and one in Europe.

[establishing connections]: /docs/layers/networking

To change the relay servers used,
for example when running your own relay server,
they can be configured in the configuration file.

This is what the default configuration for the Relay nodes would look like:
```toml
[[relay_nodes]]
url = "https://use1-1.derp.iroh.network."
stun_only = false
stun_port = 3478

[[relay_nodes]]
url = "https://euw1-1.derp.iroh.network."
stun_only = false
stun_port = 3478

[[relay_nodes]]
url = "https://aps1-1.relay.iroh.network."
stun_only = false
stun_port = 3478
```

### GC Policy

The blob store needs to run garbage collection to remove unused blobs.
This allows configuring garbage collection:

```toml
[gc_policy]
enabled = true
interval = 300
```

Here `interval` is the interval *in seconds* after which GC cycles will run.
If `enabled` is `false` GC is disabled and the interval ignored.

### Metrics collection

The iroh node can have a Prometheus metrics server.
This is enabled by configuring the address on which metrics should be served:

```toml
metrics_addr = "127.0.0.1:9090"
```

### File logging

By default log files are created in `$IROH_DATA_DIR/logs/` and are rotated once per hour using the filename patter of `iroh.YYYY-MM-DD-HH.log`.
This can also be customised in the configuration file however:

```toml
[file_logging]
rust_log = "debug"
max_files = 4
rotation = "hourly"
dir = "/path/to/data/dir/logs/"
```

- The `rust_log` field can be used to customize the [tracing-subscriber `EnvFilter`].
  All logs matching this filter will be recorded in the logfile.

- The `max_files` field configures how many old log files should be kept.
  If there are more log files the oldes ones will be deleted.

- The `rotation` field configurs how often the logfile is rotated and a new logfile created:
  - `hourly` creates a new file every hour.
  - `daily` creates a new file once a day.
  - `never` will never create a new logfile.

- The `dir` field allows changing the directory in which the logfiles are created.
  This field can **not** contain any special shell expansion characters or environment variables, it must be a full path name.

Additionally [tracing-subscriber `EnvFilter`] can also be specified using an *environment variable*.
The `IROH_FILE_RUST_LOG` environment variable **will override** the `file_logging.rust_log` field.

[tracing-subscriber `EnvFilter`]: https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html


### Full example

The full default configuration would more or less be specified as:

```toml
metrics_addr = "127.0.0.1:9090"

[[relay_nodes]]
url = "https://use1-1.derp.iroh.network."
stun_only = false
stun_port = 3478

[[relay_nodes]]
url = "https://euw1-1.derp.iroh.network."
stun_only = false
stun_port = 3478

[[relay_nodes]]
url = "https://aps1-1.relay.iroh.network."
stun_only = false
stun_port = 3478

[gc_policy]
enabled = false

[file_logging]
rust_log = "debug"
max_files = 4
rotation = "hourly"

# The default directory for the log files can not be
# expressed here since environment variables can not
# be used and the location varies by platform.
# Omitting # it will result in the default being used.
#dir = "$IROH_DATA_DIR/logs/"
```

## Environment Variables

The Following is a full list of environment variables the iroh CLI will use:

- `IROH_CONFIG_DIR`

  The location where the configuration file will be loaded from.

- `IROH_DATA_DIR`

  The location where iroh will store all state by default.
  Including the log files.

- `IROH_FILE_RUST_LOG`

  Overrides the [tracing-subscriber `EnvFilter`] used for the log file,
  see above.

- `IROH_AUTHOR`

  The default [document author](/docs/layers/documents) to use.

- `IROH_DOC`

  The default [document](/docs/layers/documents) to use.
