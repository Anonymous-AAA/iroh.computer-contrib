# Networking

At the core of iroh is the ability to connect _any_ two devices, no matter where they are. {{className: 'lead'}}

## Nodes

An iroh network is a collection of _nodes_. A node is a running process that might accept connections from other nodes on a given port. Multiple nodes can be run on the same physical device, but not the same port.

A node has a cryptographic keypair used for signing messages. Nodes are uniquely identified by the public portion of their keypair.

## Connections

An iroh connection is a [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) connection running on a _MagicSocket_. QUIC is a modern transport protocol that provides a reliable, encrypted, multiplexed connection between two nodes. QUIC is built on top of UDP, and is designed to be used in situations where TCP is not a good fit (such as mobile networks).

## MagicSockets

Connections in iroh have a _MagicSocket_ sitting between QUIC and the operating system socket (the "real socket"). The MagicSocket simulates a connection for the quic transport, and dynamically optimizes the connection path between two nodes as connections are negotiated & optimized. The MagicSocket will perform _interactive connectivity establishment_ (ICE), using an advertised set of connection details to audition connections. The MagicSocket will perform latency probes for any viable connections, switching to find the fastest ping.

## Relays

Sometimes it isn't possible to establish a direct connection between two nodes, often because of strict firewall rules or NAT configurations. In these cases the only fallback is to _relay_ traffic through a third node that both nodes can connect to. Instead of sending packets directly from one node to the other, packets in either direction are first sent to the relay node, which forwards packets on to their destination. All QUIC traffic is encrypted, and relayed traffic is no exception. The relaying server _cannot_ inspect the contents of the packets being forwarded.
