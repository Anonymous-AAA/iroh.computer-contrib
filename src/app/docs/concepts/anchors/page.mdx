An “anchor node” is a high availability box that supports a network. It mainly provides content routing & data availability {{ className: 'lead'}}

<Note>
[iroh.network](https://iroh.network) is a hosted service for running anchor nodes, made by the same developers as iroh.<br />

Anchors play a similar role to servers in a traditional app. The anchor will help your app’s users find each other, and serve as a fallback If no peers are online. This setup gives you the best of both worlds: your app works consistently & distributes dynamically as peers come online, prioritizing end-user experience above all.

## Anchor-per-app

Anchors are intended to align to the type of content similar users may be seeking. For example, a social media app may have a single anchor for all users, while a multiplayer game may have an anchor per game type. Entriprise deployments may use a single anchor per organization.

## Anchors are not networks

Iroh clients by default can connect to _any_ other peer that speaks the iroh protocol, and instead only choose their anchor through configuration. Creating an entirely separate network requires _connection-level authentication_, which iroh does not yet support.

In practice, nodes that either an anchor or content with each other will connect to each other, and apps will embed a predtermined anchor (or anchors), which will isolate the app from the rest of the network in practical terms.
