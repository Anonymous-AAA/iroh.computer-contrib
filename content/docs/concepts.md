# Multiaddress
A multiaddress (often abbreviated `multiaddr`), is a convention for encoding multiple layers of addressing information into a single “future-proof” path structure. It [defines](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr) human-readable and machine-optimized encodings of common transport and overlay protocols and allows many layers of addressing to be combined and used together.
